The difference between a CLI and GUI is the type of interaction the user will experience. With a 
CLI or Command Line Interface the user puts in system specific commands in order to interact 
with the operating system. With a GUI or Graphical User Interface the user is able interact 
with the operating system using a graphical interface. When dealing with more naive users the 
graphical interface makes it much easier to understand the process of pushing, pulling and 
merging branches. The GUI provides graphics and menus which makes it easier to observe and
operate multiple files at the same time. The CLI however is much more simple because for a
user to use the CLI they only need a keyboard whereas with a GUI a user needs a mouse and
keyboard. The CLI also uses less memory and is typically faster than the GUI. The simplicity of
the CLI does provide a challenge for a naive user when it comes to learning the system specific
commands. I remember when I first started learning how to use the CLI and the system specific
commands are pretty vague and not self explanatory. Had I been trying to learn it on my own
and not in a CSCI course it would have probably taken me a lot longer to understand.
