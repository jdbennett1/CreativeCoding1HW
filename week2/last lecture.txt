This video made me feel confused. He tells the story of him trying to achieve his childhood dreams. The fact that he achieved any of them is quite impressive to me, but he doesn’t stop and enjoy it. Pausch finally achieves his first dream of working as an Imagineer for Disney while on a sabbatical for 6 months then at the end of his sabbatical they offer him a full time job but he says no. I don’t understand, if it was one of his dreams to work for disney in a creative capacity like an imagineer and he says how wonderful his time was there why would he choose to leave? Pausch mentions that in saying no, he got his cake and ate it too by becoming a weekly consultant for the next 10 years. I resonate with the message he says about brick walls and ways to work around them, as life is all about working through adversity to achieve your dreams. The first wall was how he had clawed his way into a potential position at the Imagineers through many different outlets and eventually convinced Jon, the lead Imagineer, at a lunch to let him work with them. Once he got through this wall he came upon another, his university. The first department head he went to didn't like the contract he and Jon had created. Pausch then gets into a pissing match with the department head and realizes he needs a different approach. Pausch then goes to one his university's deans and gets the permission to work with the imagineers. Pausch does all of this to work for 6 months, technically for free, then says no to the job he is offered. I suppose he wanted to keep chasing his dreams as he continued to work in the realm of creativity with virtual worlds by creating the ETC course with a fellow professor. Teaching students exactly what he worked on as an imagineer.
