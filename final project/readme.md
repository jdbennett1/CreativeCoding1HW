### **project proposal**
My project idea is a to make a spiderman platformer game. My inspiration for this project is the 1992 NES game spiderman: return of the sinister 6. It is a game I've owned for a few years now and I have literally never even beat the 1st level. I think it is achievable to make at least the platforming part of a game. 

### **Challenges**
I am currently studying the p5play documentation and wokring on getting some objects movable with physics. I found a sprite sheet of spiderman i plan to use but i have yet to make use of it in animation. I have been researching how to use sprite sheets in p5play/p5js and it is rather complicated to get it working. 

### **Development plan**
I plan to get the physics working with objects by the end of the week. Then I plan to get the sprite sheet to work in p5play. Ihen once I have both working pieces I will combine them to make the platformer.

### **week 1:**
I have been able to create sprites using p5play and its functions but I can not seem to get the movement to work, I have tried a bunch a different ways to implement the movement based on the p5play documentation but I think it is a library issue with the web editor not referncing the p5play library.
